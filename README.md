# Pokédex Diary 🧾✨

Welcome to **Pokédex Diary** — your very own digital Pokémon companion!  
Built with love (and plenty of `fetch` requests) by two junior devs learning to master the frontend world.

## 📖 What It Is

Pokédex Diary is a lightweight web app powered by the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/). You can browse, search, and favorite your favorite Pokémon, and even add personal journal notes for each one!

## 🔍 Features

- **Homepage**

  - Browse Pokémon with images and stats straight from the API
  - Search by name or ID (no full search endpoint—got creative with logic!)
  - All favorites stored locally in `localStorage`

- **Journal Page**

  - Write personal notes for each Pokémon
  - Notes are saved locally, Pokémon-by-Pokémon

- **Navigation**
  - A simple navbar to switch between catching and journaling

## 💅 Styling

Crafted with the power of **TailwindCSS** for a clean, modern, and responsive look.

## 📁 File Structure

- `index.html` — Homepage
- `journal.html` — Journal Page
- `main.js` — Logic for homepage
- `journal.js` — Logic for journal page

## 👾 Junior Devs at Work

This is a fun, collaborative learning project between two junior developers.  
Expect a mix of clean code, creative solutions, and a few Pokéballs thrown in the wrong direction. 😉
